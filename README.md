## Summary

cloud-ingress-operator is designed to assist in toggling OpenShift Dedicated 4.x clusters "private" and "public" through the use of custom Kubernetes resources.

There are two pieces of the cluster which can be toggled in this way: The default API server (`api.<cluster-domain>`) and the ingresses (the default being `*.apps.<cluster-domain>`, and up to one additional, named `*.apps2.<cluster-domain>`). These may be handled independently of one another in the manner described below.

To ensure that [Hive](https://github.com/openshift/hive) and SRE have continued access to manage the cluster on behalf of the customer, an additional API endpoint is created, named by default `rh-api.<cluster-domain>`. This endpoint may also be referred to as the "admin endpoint," or "admin API endpoint."

The operator does not manage any kind of VPC peering or VPN connectivity into the clustered environment.

## Controlling the Operator

As mentioned above, the operator is controlled through custom Kubernetes resources, `APIScheme` and `PublishingStrategy`. They are documented below:

### APIScheme Custom Resource

The APIScheme resource instructs the operator to create the admin API endpoint. The specification of the resource is explained below:

```yaml
spec:
  managementAPIServerIngress:
    enabled: true
    dnsName: rh-api
    allowedCIDRBlocks:
      - "0.0.0.0/0"
```

In this example, the endpoint will be called `rh-api` and the full name `rh-api.<cluster-domain>`. Furthermore, there will be a single entry in the security group associated with the cloud load balancer that allows `0.0.0.0/0` (everything).

### Toggling Privacy

Toggling privacy is done with the `PublishingStrategy` custom resource.

```yaml
spec:
  defaultAPIServerIngress:
    listening: external
  applicationIngress:
    - listening: external
      default: true
      dnsName: "*.apps"
      certificate:
        secretRef:
          name: foo
      routeSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            foo: bar
```

In this example, the default API server (`api.<cluster-domain>`) is configured to be externally available ("public") and the default ingress (named `*.apps.<cluster-domain>`, and identified by `default: true`) is configured to also be externally available ("public"). Additionally, the default ingress is configured to use a TLS certificate named `foo`, in the `openshift-ingress` namespace. Finally, the ingress uses the route selector as specified.

Note: the `namespace` attribute for `secretRef` is not currently used; certificates must be within the `openshift-ingress` namespace.

It is possible to add additional applicationIngresses, however at this time, OSD supports the default plus an additional.

## Testing

### Manual deployment of CIO onto fleets.
* Pause syncset to the cluster [SOP](https://github.com/openshift/ops-sop/blob/master/v4/knowledge_base/pause-syncset.md)
* Delete all the resources related to cloud-ingress-operator:

```shell
oc delete catalogsource cloud-ingress-operator-registry -n openshift-cloud-ingress-operator
oc delete operatorgroup cloud-ingress-operator -n openshift-cloud-ingress-operator
oc delete subscription cloud-ingress-operator -n openshift-cloud-ingress-operator
oc delete csv cloud-ingress-operator.<version> -n openshift-cloud-ingress-operator
```

* Commit your changes(otherwise bp doesn't let you produce an image), bake the image with `make docker-build`
* Tag and publish the image to your own repo
```shell
docker tag quay.io/app-sre/cloud-ingress-operator:latest quay.io/<organization>/cloud-ingress-operator:latest
docker push quay.io/<organization>/cloud-ingress-operator:latest
```

* Edit [deploy.yaml](deploy/50_cloud-ingress-operator.Deployment.yaml) and replace the image with yours: `image: REPLACE_IMAGE`
* Apply the resources manually: `oc apply -f deploy/`
* For olm based deployments, the clusterrolebinding between cloud-ingress-operator SA and clusterrole is automatically created. For manual deployments,
it needs to be created afterwards the resources have been deployed:
```shell
oc create clusterrolebinding cloud-ingress-operator --clusterrole=cloud-ingress-operator --serviceaccount=openshift-cloud-ingress-operator:cloud-ingress-operator --namespace=openshift-cloud-ingress-operator
```

### Manual testing of default and nondefault ingresscontroller

Due to a race condition with the [cluster-ingress-operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-ingress-operator) we test the logic flow of ingresscontroller manually. Once you are in a cluster, here are the steps to do so:

- Pause syncset to the cluster [SOP](https://github.com/openshift/ops-sop/blob/master/v4/knowledge_base/pause-syncset.md)
- Check the inital state of the ingresscontrollers on cluster before the test by running `oc get ingresscontrollers -n openshift-ingress-operator`
  - In this test, we assume there is only one ingresscontroller called `default`.
- Apply a sample `PublishingStrategy` CR with these specs

```yaml
spec:
  defaultAPIServerIngress:
    listening: external
  applicationIngress:
    - listening: external
      default: true
      dnsName: "apps.sample.default.domain"
      certificate:
        secretRef:
          name: foo
    - listening: internal
      default: false
      dnsName: "apps2.sample.nondefault.domain"
      certificate:
        secretRef:
          name: bar
      routeSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            foo: bar
```
- Looking at `applicationIngress`, the expected result will be the creation of 2 ingresscontrollers, `default` and `apps2`. The `default` ingresscontroller will
have all the attributes of the first `applicationIngress` replacing the old `default` ingresscontroller, and `apps2` will have the attributes of the second `applicationIngress`. To check these results, run `oc get ingresscontrollers -n openshift-ingress-operator` and view each `ingresscontroller` as yaml.
- NOTE: it might take up to 60 seconds for these changes to apply due to a race condition.


# Development

The operator is built with [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk). There is a tight dependency on the AWS cluster provider but the dependency is pinned to the [OpenShift fork](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-api-provider-aws) for access to v1beta1 API features.

## Debugging the operator

You can quickly debug the operator on your existing OSD cluster by following the below steps. It is recommended to do this against a staging cluster. 

1. Connect to your cluster through backplane or directly

2. Elevate your permissions: `oc adm groups add-users osd-sre-cluster-admins $(oc whoami)`

3. Scale down `cluster-version-operator` and `cloud-ingress-operator`
  ```bash
  oc scale --replicas 0 -n openshift-cluster-version deployments/cluster-version-operator

  oc scale --replicas 0 -n openshift-cloud-ingress-operator deployments cloud-ingress-operator
  ```

4. Debug! If you are using VSCode, create/update your `launch.json` as followed

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [{
        "type": "go",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch Program",
        "program": "${workspaceFolder}/cmd/manager/main.go",
        "env":{
            "WATCH_NAMESPACE": "openshift-cloud-ingress-operator,openshift-ingress,openshift-ingress-operator,openshift-kube-apiserver,openshift-machine-api"
        }
    }]
}
```
